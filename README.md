### About me

Hi, I'm someone who loves building tech. For over 15 years, I've worked with computers, software, and teams. I'm good at making sure things run smoothly and work well.

I know how to write code and lead teams. I've helped big companies and also worked on free, open projects. I like solving problems and making things better.
