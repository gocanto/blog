### Who Am I?

I'm a full-stack Software Engineer leader with over two decades of building complex web systems and products,
specialising in areas like e-commerce, banking, cross-payment solutions, cybersecurity, and customer success.

Iâ€™ve led teams in designing and delivering scalable, high-performance systems that run efficiently even in complex
environments. Beyond writing code, I focus on helping teams work better together by improving workflows and encouraging
innovation.
